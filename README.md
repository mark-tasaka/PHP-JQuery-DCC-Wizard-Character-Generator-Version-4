# PHP-JQuery-DCC-Wizard-Character-Generator-Version-4
The fourth iteration of the Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) Wizard Character Generator, which builds upon the DCC Wizard Character Generator Version 3 (https://github.com/mark-tasaka/php-jquery-dcc-wizard-character-generator-version-3). The DCC Wizard Character Generator allows Users to generate a random Wizard Character with a series of options available for customizing the randomly generated character.

The two most notable differences between Version 3 and Version 4 of the DCC Wizard Character Generators are:

1. The random name generator for Version 4 is built upon the PHP-Character-Name-Generator (https://github.com/mark-tasaka/PHP-Character-Name-Generator); thus, providing both a greater selection of random names, and the ability to customize random name by selecting names based on country of origins.

2. The ability to customize ability score through the selection of ability score values.
